# Electronic Property InterChange (EPIC)


## Description of the Project

The Electronic Property InterChange (EPIC) is a Python-based alternative multiple listing service built on the Django web framework for alternative brokers. Overall, EPIC is a digital platform created with the intention of buying, selling and renting real estate properties. EPIC has one goal: to offer a large variety of features with the goal of smoothing the entire real estate transaction process. This means combining convenience and efficiency and delivering to all users. This service targets 4 primary users: Homebuyers, Property renters, real-state brokers and system administrator(s). Why choose EPIC? Homebuyers & property renters will have the ability to search for properties, save their favourites, search for brokers and visit properties of interest. Additionally, Homebuyers will have the option of using a Mortgage Calculator serving as a secure tool to confidently adventure the housing market. Next off, real-state brokers will be able to conveniently submit offers & request visits on behalf of their clients, independently match properties to clients on the EPIC platform and more! Lastly, system administrators (s) will have the functionalities necessary to manage brokers on the listing service.

###  Project Approach and Technology
#### Back-end languages
Python:  Python  is  chosen  as  a  programming  language  used  for  this project since  everyone  on  this  team  knows  how  to  use  it  or  will  have  to  learn  it  at  some  point during  their  studies.  Also,  it  was  agreed upon  that  it  was a programming  language  that is  simple  to  use.<br/><br/>

#### Database
MYSQL: MySQL uses the Structured Query Language (SQL) to interact with the database. SQL is a standard language for querying and manipulating relational databases. Users can use SQL commands to create, retrieve, update, and delete data.

#### Front-end languages
HyperText Markup Language (HTML): HTML is the basic markup language allowing to display content of documents in the browser. <br/><br/>
Cascading Style Sheet (CSS): CSS is a styling sheet language that allows the modification of the visible aspects of the content provided by HTML. This language allows the visual enhancement of the user interface.<br/> <br/>
JavaScript (JS): JS is a programming language that provides users the ability to interact with the website.<br/><br/>
These three languages were chosen to design the client side because they are known by everyone on the team. These languages were also taught in the web programming class SOEN287.

#### Project Approach
The project approach will follow the agile scrum methodology. Indeed, the project will be planned in a series of increments known as sprints where new versions will be made to be evaluated. This will help modify the procedure when the clients demand changes. In fact, this approach prioritizes change instead of planning. Also, this project is more focused on interaction instead of procedures or tools. This includes collaborating with the client and conversations that are face-to-face since it is easier to spread information. It is important to collaborate with the client since their satisfaction is the top priority. Furthermore, there is a product backlog or task breakdown, which is the list of things to get accomplished for the next sprint and it is taken from the needs mentioned in the user stories. The task to be adopted by a member will be based on the amount of effort that is needed. It also mentions the elapsed time for the due date. The product backlog or task breakdown document can be found in the wiki. This backlog must be verified regularly so that the needs are met in time for the next sprint where a version of the project will be made available. Once a team member produces content, there is a document for a log of each member's contribution to the ideal time spent. Additional rules can be found on the wiki.
